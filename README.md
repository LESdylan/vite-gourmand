*This project was created as part of the Studi curriculum by dylan lesieur*

> A from scratch web page designed to be hackable, observable and pleasant to use.

## Quick Start

## What Is This Project ?
Vite & Gourmand is a company constituted of two people Julie and José. To overcome the stream flow of client and new opportuntities both of them had the idea to create a webpage that make their webpage more visible.
They chose to hire a tenary company that would provide the service of building this webpage for them.

`FastDev` is the name of the company and chosen to lead teh project as soon as possible. 
Delivering a quick and efficient prototype but also appealing enouh and accessile are rules that make this task harder..

From this `30/01/2026`. I've got around two weeks to come with a solution and make it both operational, and practical.

The main purpose of this webpage is to show the menus and give the possibility to the user to order their dishes..

## Architecture of this webpage

### Database
The firs things we're very sure about is how the datas has to be treated as the school gave us how to implement them throught a diagram UML.



## Why This Project ?
This project is my ECF alias continual formation assesment from my other school studi that I applied to pass the title of webd eveloper full stack.

The project gives a certain amount of freedoms and requirements that I need follow along the way I'm doing the webpage.

## Current State of the project

## Use Of AI
**Documentation & Research** - Used to clarify ambiguities in edge cases where conventions differ and to research complex topics not detailed in standard textbooks, ensuring realistic solutinos within the project's scope.

**Concept explanation** - Served as a study aid to solidify the understanding of abstract functionalities and architectural requirements necessary for building a 
webpage

**Code Generation** - Not used for logic implementation; limited to clarifcation stufy


## ❤️ Why I Loved Working On It
- It's a genuine, real-world project I could reason about
- it rewards careful thought about APIs, ownership, and semantics
- It's fun to see it get closer and closer to real project that we could use daily
